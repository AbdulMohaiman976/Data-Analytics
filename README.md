# Data-Analytics
This repository showcases a series of data analytics tasks and mini-projects developed using Python. These projects are inspired by concepts learned from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", and are designed to reinforce key principles through hands-on practice.

Key Highlights:
Data exploration and preprocessing

Application of classification, regression, and other statistical learning techniques

Insight generation through visualizations and data-driven analysis

Use of essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn

The focus throughout these projects is on understanding data, building models, and drawing meaningful conclusions using practical tools from the Python ecosystem.
